Installation:

go get github.com/unixdj/ussssr
go install github.com/unixdj/ussssr


Usage:

ussssr [-b] COMMAND [ARGS...]

USSSSR listens to sleep (suspend, hibernate) events broadcast by
UPower or systemd on D-Bus and reacts to them by running a
command which presumably will activate a screen saver to lock the
screen.

Upon startup USSSSR tries to open the systemd backend; if it's
not available, UPower is tried; if that ain't there either, we
bail out.

In case the systemd backend is chosen, USSSSR inhibits sleep by
taking a delay lock.  Unless the flag -b was passed, USSSSR will
wait until the program finishes before releasing the lock, or
unil it times out (three seconds).  Thus, commands such as
"xset s activate" and "xscreensaver -lock", that activate the
screen saver and exit, should be run in the foreground (i.e.,
don't use -b).

Regardless of whether the commands are run in the foreground or
in the background, no more than one copy of the program will run
at any time.  If a sleep event arrives while the program is
running, the event will be swallowed.
